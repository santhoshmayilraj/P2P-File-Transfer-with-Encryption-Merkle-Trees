# **P2P File Transfer with Encryption & Merkle Trees**

Hi Again, This is Santhosh, your friendly neighbourhood coder. Alright, letâ€™s do this one last timeâ€”this is **Secure P2P File Transfer**.

Welcome to this encrypted, integrity-verified file-sharing system! Here, we blend peer-to-peer networking, Caesar cipher encryption, and Merkle Trees to ensure your files are transferred securely and remain tamper-proof.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- âœ” **Encrypted Chunks** â€“ Files split & secured with Caesar cipher
- âœ” **Merkle Root Verification** â€“ Ensures zero tampering during transfer
- âœ” **P2P Architecture** â€“ Direct client-server file exchange
- âœ” **Lightweight & Fast** â€“ Chunk-based processing for efficiency

## ðŸ›  How It Works

### ðŸ“¤ Uploading a File (Client â†’ Server)
1. Client sends a file (split into 10-byte chunks)
2. Server:
   - Encrypts each chunk (`caesar_encrypt`)
   - Generates SHA-256 hashes per chunk
   - Builds a Merkle Tree for integrity checks
   - Stores metadata (`filename_metadata.csv`, `chunk_metadata.csv`)

### ðŸ“¥ Downloading a File (Server â†’ Client)
1. Client requests a file
2. Server:
   - Verifies integrity using Merkle Root Hash
   - Decrypts chunks (`caesar_decrypt`)
   - Sends back the original file (if intact)

## ðŸ”’ Encryption & Integrity

- **Caesar Cipher** â€“ Shifts ASCII chars by +3 (encrypt) / -3 (decrypt)
- **Merkle Tree** â€“ Detects any file corruption via root hash

## How to Run

### Steps

1. **Start the Server**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. **Upload a File**
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

3. **Download a File**
    ```bash
    python client_request.py
    ```

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ client.py               # Uploads files to server  
â”œâ”€â”€ client_request.py       # Requests file download  
â”œâ”€â”€ server.py               # Handles uploads  
â”œâ”€â”€ server_response.py      # Handles downloads  
â”œâ”€â”€ caesar_encrypt.py       # Encrypts chunks  
â”œâ”€â”€ caesar_decrypt.py       # Decrypts chunks  
â”œâ”€â”€ merkel_tree.py          # Merkle Root Hash generator  
â”œâ”€â”€ filename_metadata.csv   # File metadata storage  
â””â”€â”€ chunk_metadata.csv      # Chunk hashes & encrypted data  
```

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?
